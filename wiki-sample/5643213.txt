The 1997 National League Division Series (NLDS), the opening round of the 1997 National League playoffs, began on Tuesday, September 30, and ended on Friday, October 3, with the champions of the three NL divisions—along with a "wild card" team—participating in two best-of-five series.

***LIST***.
"The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage, which was not tied to playing record but was predetermined—a highly unpopular arrangement which was discontinued after the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs.
Also, the team with home field "advantage" was required to play the first two games on the road, with potentially the last three at home, in order to reduce travel.
Had the 1997 NLDS been played under the post-1997 arrangement, then Atlanta (1) would still have faced off against Houston (3) and San Francisco (2) would likewise have faced off against the wild card winners in Florida (4)."
The Atlanta Braves and Florida Marlins went on to meet in the NL Championship Series (NLCS).
The Marlins became the National League champions, and defeated the American League champion Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series.
